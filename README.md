## Overview
This project is part of my portfolio, showcasing my skills in **data analysis and machine learning.** The primary goal of this project is to analyze transaction data and predict whether a given transaction is fraudulent or non-fraudulent.  

### Key Highlights:
- Built multiple machine learning models to classify fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.
- Includes **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** for understanding the dataset structure and patterns.
- Applied techniques to handle imbalanced datasets effectively.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries/Frameworks**:  
  - NumPy  
  - Pandas  
  - Matplotlib  
  - Scikit-learn  
- **Notebook**: Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)  

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd your-repo-name
3. Install the required libraries:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
   jupyter notebook your-notebook-name.ipynb
   
## Features
Data Preprocessing:
Performed data cleaning to handle missing or inconsistent values.
Addressed imbalanced datasets using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) or other resampling methods.
Model Building:

Trained multiple models including:
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Decision Tree
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Evaluation:
Comparison of model performance based on accuracy:

Model Name	Accuracy
Logistic Regression	92%
Support Vector Machine	88%
Decision Tree	88%
K-Nearest Neighbors	61%
## Results
Achieved Results:
The Logistic Regression model achieved the highest accuracy of 93% on the test dataset.

## Key Insights:

Fraudulent transactions typically exhibit distinct patterns in the dataset.
Proper handling of imbalanced datasets significantly improves model performance.
